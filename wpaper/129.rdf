Title: Road Infrastructure and Enterprise Dynamics in Ethiopia

Abstract:  This paper investigates firm level responses to a large scale public investment program on road
infrastructure in Ethiopia during 1997 to 2010. Firms' location choices and average start-up size
are examined by combining town level panel data on road accessibility with a panel of
manufacturing firms for the period 1996 to 2009. We find econometric results showing that
better road access increases a town's attractiveness for manufacturing firms. While towns with
initially large number of firms continue to attract more firms, there has been a tendency toward
convergence in the distribution of firms, reducing their geographic concentration. Average startup
size in isolated locations is also smaller relative to firms entering well connected markets in
terms of road access. We conclude that improved road infrastructure has a favorable impact on
the entry patterns and structure of the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia.
