Title: Structural Policies and Growth: 
Time Series Evidence from a Natural Experiment



Abstract:  Documenting the long term impact of structural policies on
economic performance has generated tremendous interest in the
development literature. In contrast, contemporary effects of structural
policies are difficult to establish. Structural policies seldom change
sufficiently in the short run, and accepted instruments to control for
endogeneity in cross sections are inappropriate for time series
analysis. In this paper we utilize an eleven year panel of 26 transition
countries to identify short term effects of structural policies that are
large and significant. A ten percent change in the quality of structural
policies (or the Rule of Law) towards OECD standards is shown to raise
annual growth by about 2.5 percent. To control for endogeneity, we
instrument using the hierarchy of institutions hypothesis and find that
it holds robust explanatory power. We also document that early reformers
reap the greatest benefits, but that it is never too late to begin
structural policy reforms.
