Title:  A Risk-Based Rationale for Two-way Capital Flows:  Why Do
Capital Flights and Inward Foreign Direct Investments Co-exist?
Abstract:  This paper develops a positive theory of two-way capital
flows -- the simultaneous outward  flight of capital assets, and the
inflow of foreign direct investment that acquires ownership of  local
production units. The basic model exploits insights from
entrepreneurial decision making  under uncertainty in a general
equilibrium setting, and traces out the relationship between (i) 
entrepreneurial incentives to exploit higher expected profits from
risky production activities at  the firm level and (ii) the resulting
competitive rewards to capital in general equilibrium. The  model shows
that contrary to expectation, relatively liquid capital assets tend to
flow from  capital-poor to capital-rich economies, while foreign direct
investment aimed at acquiring ownership of production units follows the
reversed pattern. We also examine the optimal  investment policies for
both host and origin countries, and show the rationale behind the
inherent  conflict of interests between developing and developed
economies in the context of capital  market liberalization.
