Title:  Dynamic Discrete Choice Modeling: Monte Carlo Analysis

Abstract:  Recent work on spatial models of commercial fishing has provided insights into how spatial
regulatory policies (i.e. Marine Protected Areas) are likely to alter the fishing location choices of
commercial fishermen and the efficiency of these policies. The applied studies have spanned a
diverse range of fisheries, from sedentary to highly migratory species. This literature has largely
ignored the inter-temporal aspects of commercial fishing site choice at the cruise level.
Therefore, these models depict fishermen as if they are ignoring how a location choice on the
first day of a cruise may have potentially important consequences for the rest of the cruise. For
many fisheries, particularly highly migratory ones, fishermen might choose a dynamically
optimal cruise trajectory rather than myopic day-by-day strategies. An econometric model that
ignores the inter-temporal aspects of location choice will likely lead to erroneous conclusions
regarding a vessel’s response to spatial regulatory policies. A dynamic discrete choice model is
developed herein that utilizes the same information conventionally used in static models but is
entrenched in the principals of dynamic optimization (Bellman’s principle). Using Monte Carlo
analysis, we evaluate the relative performance of this estimator as compared to the conventional
static model for a variety of conditions that mimic different fishery types.
