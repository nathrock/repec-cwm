Title:  Does Crime Pay? A Classroom Demonstration of Monitoring and Enforcement

Abstract:  This paper presents a classroom game in which students choose whether or not to comply with
pollution regulations. By changing the level of monitoring and fines for noncompliance across
periods, the game shows students how the probability and severity of enforcement affects
incentives for compliance. The game can be adapted for settings other than environmental
regulation and can be used in a variety of classes including regulation, law and economics,
environmental economics, public economics, or the economics of crime. It can easily be
conducted in a fifty-minute class period.
