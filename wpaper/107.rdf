Title: On the effects of highway investment on the regional concentration of
economic activity in the USA



Abstract:  The empirical results in this note are based on state-level VAR estimates using private output, employment, and
investment, as well as different measures of highway investment to capture, for each state, both the direct effects of
highway investment in the state itself and spillover effects of highway investment in other states. Empirical results
suggest that the largest states tend to also be the biggest beneficiaries of highway investments which means that
highway investment has not only contributed to regional concentration of economic activity in the country but has done
so in many of the largest states thereby contributing to regional asymmetries in the country.
