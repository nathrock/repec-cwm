Title:  Does Banning Affirmative Action Affect Racial SAT Score Gaps? 
An Empirical Analysis

Abstract:  This paper conducts an empirical analysis of SAT scores to
determine if banning affirmative action has any significant impact on
the SAT scores of college bound minority high school students. A
rational high school student should alter the amount of time spent
studying during high school if any policy affects the marginal return to
that activity. Thus, a natural question to ask is whether banning
affirmative action affects minorities’ SAT scores differently than it
affects non–minorities’ SAT scores. My analysis centers on the recent
elimination of affirmative action in California and Texas. Using SAT
data obtained from The College Board, I compare the changes of the test
score gap between minorities and non–minorities over time in the
treatment states, relative to a set of control group states.
