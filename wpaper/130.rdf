Title: U.S. Immigration Policy at a Crossroads

Abstract:  Two issues have taken center stage in the recent debates about U.S. immigration policy: one,
illegal immigration and more generally the entrance of poorly educated individuals into the U.S.
economy and two, whether the U.S. should continue its family-based admissions system or move
towards a skills-based system. This paper analyzes these issues culling evidence from the history
of U.S. immigration policy, the experiences of different types of U.S. immigrants, and crossnational
comparisons.
