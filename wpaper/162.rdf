Title: Clean energy firms’ stock prices,
technology, oil prices, and carbon price

Abstract: Production costs of alternative energies are still high, but
increased demand for oil, future oil supply shortage concerns and climate
change concerns, have led to the fast development of renewable energy
firms. The sector accomplished has accomplished remarkable progress
and attracted attention to clean energy, both at the industry level and at the
academic side. With this work we attempt to determine whether or not the
placement of a price on carbon emissions encourages investments in clean
energy firms. Unlike previous literature we focus on the German case and
we address the issue at the individual company level. We were able to
verify this link but only for the case of companies whose weight over the
amount of total energy produced is relevant, which is the case of solar in
Germany.
