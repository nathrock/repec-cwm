Title:  Social Welfare Functions that Satisfy Pareto, Anonymity, 
and Neutrality: Countable Many Alternatives 




Abstract:  For a finite number of alternatives, in the presence of
Pareto, non-dictatorship, full domain, and transitivity, an extremely
weak independence condition is incompatible with each of anonymity and
neutrality (Campbell and Kelly [2006]).  This paper explores how those
results are affected when there are countably many alternatives.
