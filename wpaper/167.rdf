Title:  Job Creation and Trade in Manufactures: Industry Level Analysis Across Countries

Abstract:  This paper examines industry level responses of manufacturing employment in the context of
globalization using a large sample of developed, developing and transition economies. We find
that developing countries need atypically high rates of value added growth (about 10%) to
increase manufacturing employment appreciably (about 4%). The employment benefits of
export-orientation are also modest even in "comparative advantage" industries of developing
countries. However, diversifying the export basket contributes significantly to employment
growth, particularly in the medium- and high-technology industries. Import-competition does not
undermine employment growth in low-technology industries of developing countries while it
displaces jobs in the same industries in OECD and transition economies. For developing
countries, import-induced job losses are higher in the more capital-intensive medium-technology
industries. Jobs in high-technology industries are less sensitive to imports with positive
relationships observed in the OECD. Investment also complements job creation in lowtechnology
industries of developing countries that have yet to industrialize.
