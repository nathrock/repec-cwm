Title:  The Effects of Joint Taxation of Married Couples on Labor Supply and Non-wage Income 

Abstract:  The United States changed its tax treatment of married
couples in 1948, from a system in which each spouse paid taxes on his or
her own income to a system in which a married couple is taxed as a unit.
The switch from separate to joint taxation changed incentives for labor
supply and asset ownership. This paper investigates the effects of the
conversion to joint taxation, taking advantage of a natural experiment
created by cross-state variation in property laws. Married individuals
in states with community property laws had always been taxed as if each
spouse had earned half of the couple's income, and thus were unaffected
by the 1948 legal change. Comparing the behavior of taxpayers in
affected and unaffected states indicates that the tax change is
associated with a decline of 0.9-1.6 percentage points in the labor
force participation rate of married women, consistent with the higher
first-dollar tax rates they faced after 1948. Married women were also
0.6-1.9 percentage points less likely to have non-wage income after
1948, reflecting pre-1948 allocation of family assets to wives for tax
purposes. The effects of joint taxation on married men's labor force
participation and non-wage income holding are generally not
statistically significant.
