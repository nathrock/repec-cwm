Title: Institutional Change and Factor Movement:
A Test of the Coase Theorem's Invariance Principle


Abstract:  The strong version of the Coase Theorem suggests that in the
absence of transactions costs, the distribution of resources is
invariant to the assignment of the rights to those resources. While the
theoretical work that underlies the Theorem is vast, the empirical work
is less available. The obvious reason being the difficulty in finding
real world examples of markets that have experienced "rights" changes.
Such a change however has occurred in Major League Baseball. Starting in
the late 1970s the "rights" of players were switched from owners to
players. This allows us to examine if the distribution of players was
impacted by the change. If players switched teams more or less at the
same rate before and after the introduction of free agency, this would
support the Coase Theorem. In the end, the characteristics of player
movement do appear to have been impacted by the re-assignment of rights
and therefore are inconsistent with the predictions of the strong
version of the Coase Theorem.
