Title: 	Reducing Carbon Emissions in Portugal: 
The Relative Roles of Fossil-Fuel Prices, Energy Efficiency,
and Carbon Taxation


Abstract: We assess the relative role of fossil-fuel prices, energy efficiency and carbon taxation in achieving
climate policy goals using a dynamic general-equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy
featuring endogenous growth and a detailed modeling of public-sector activities. Given the expected
evolution of international fossil fuel prices, we show that to reach ambitious domestic reductions in
emissions, it is fundamental to promote energy efficiency and to levy a significant carbon tax.
Improving energy efficiency and implementing a new carbon tax have significantly different
economic and budgetary effects. More energy efficiency reduces emissions and boosts economic
performance, but increases public and foreign debt. In turn, the new carbon tax reduces emissions at
the risk of jeopardizing economic performance, while the effects on public and foreign debt are
more favorable. Thus, the relevance of pursuing both strategies in tandem is clear. We estimate that
under the reference-price scenario, a steady energy efficiency gain of 2-2.5% and a carbon tax of at
	least 35 euro per tCO2 are required to achieve the stated goal of reducing carbon dioxide emission by
2030 by an amount equivalent to 40% of the emissions in 1990. These views were fully integrated in
a proposal presented by the Commission for Environmental Tax Reform [CRFV (2014)] to the
Portuguese Government in September 2014 and then discussed in Parliament in November 2014,
before enacting a new carbon tax on January 1st, 2015.
