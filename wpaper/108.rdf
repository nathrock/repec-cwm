Title: On the economic effects of public infrastructure investment:A survey of the international evidence



Abstract:  This paper is an up-to-date survey of the most important literature on the effects of public
infrastructure investment on economic performance and therefore constitutes a comprehensive starting
reference for academic researchers and policy makers alike. It presents a comprehensive discussion of
the empirical research on the impact of public infrastructure investment on economic performance in
terms of both the methodological approaches and respective conclusions. It includes an integrated
discussion of the methodological developments that successively have led to the estimation of
production functions, cost and profit functions and, more recently, vector autoregressive models.
Finally, it identifies some important areas for future research and highlights the natural convergence
of this literature with the macro literature on the effects of fiscal policies.
