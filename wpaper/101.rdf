Title: NEIGHBORS AND CO-WORKERS:THE IMPORTANCE OF RESIDENTIAL LABOR MARKET NETWORKS

Abstract:  We specify and implement a test for the presence and importance of labor market network based on
residential proximity in determining the establishments at which people work. Using matched employeremployee
data at the establishment level, we measure the importance of these network effects for groups
broken out by race, ethnicity, and various measures of skill. The evidence indicates that these types of
labor market networks do exist and play an important role in determining the establishments where
workers work, that they are more important for minorities and the less-skilled, especially among
Hispanics, and that these networks appear to be race-based.
