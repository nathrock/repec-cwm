Title:  Why Executive Power Centralizes Government
Abstract:  This paper examines the effects of political parties,
executive power and efficiency on federal structure. It proposes and
tests a model of federalism in which different levels of veto power can
lead to varying degrees of centralization in the provision of central
and local governmental services when executive and legislative branches
have disparate preferences over which level should provide services.
Results for the US (1982-1992) find state and local spending centralizes
with increased veto power because, absent offsetting political party
advocacy for decentralization, central government spending interests
dominate local government spending interests.
