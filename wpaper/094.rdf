Title: Monetary Policy, Trend Inflation and the Great Moderation:An Alternative Interpretation

Abstract:  With positive trend inflation, the Taylor principle is not enough to guarantee a
determinate equilibrium. We provide new theoretical results on restoring determinacy in
New Keynesian models with positive trend inflation and combine these with new
empirical findings on the Federal Reserve’s reaction function before and after the
Volcker disinflation to find that 1) while the Fed likely satisfied the Taylor principle in the
pre-Volcker era, the US economy was still subject to self-fulfilling fluctuations in the
1970s, 2) the US economy moved from indeterminacy to determinacy during the
Volcker disinflation, and 3) the switch from indeterminacy to determinacy was due to the
changes in the Fed’s response to macroeconomic variables and the decline in trend
inflation during the Volcker disinflation.
