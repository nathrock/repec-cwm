Title:  A Test of Benefits Transfer of Random Utility Models of Recreation  Demand
Abstract:  In  this paper,  I examine  the performance  of function  transfer of
random utility models  (RUM) and show that the usual notions of reliability  and
validity need careful  examination in the  RUM context.  Because  in RUM models,
estimated behavioral parameters are not identifiable independently of the  scale
parameter, a function transfer carries with it information about preferences and
the error structure  at the study  region.   Using a  Monte Carlo experiment,  I
investigate the viability  of function transfer  when behavioral parameters  are
assumed to  be equal  but differences  in scale  exist for  the policy and study
regions.  The results show that properties of the error structure can impact the
reliability and validity of the function transfer method in RUM's under the most
ideal of situations- when the  behavioral parameters of the two  populations are
equal.
