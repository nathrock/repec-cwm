Title: 	ON THE LONG-TERM MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY SPENDING:EVIDENCE FOR 12 EU COUNTRIES



Abstract:  We estimate the long-term impact of social security and social protection spending in a set of twelve EU
countries. We estimate country-specific VARs relating GDP, unemployment, savings, and social
spending. We find that social spending has a negative effect in most countries while the effects on savings
are either not significant or positive but small. In turn, the negative effects on output are significant and in
some cases large. Unemployment is the dominant channel through which social spending affects output.
Our results imply that any increase in generosity would, under the current situation, bring detrimental
macroeconomic effects. In addition, a less distortionary tax mix should be used to finance redistributive
spending and the insurance component of the systems should be changed in the direction of a
capitalization regime based on defined contributions. Obviously, this transition would take time and
would not be costless but neither is maintaining the status quo.
