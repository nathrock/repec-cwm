Title: The Labor/Land Ratio and India’s Caste System 

Abstract:  This paper proposes that India’s caste system and involuntary labor were joint responses by a
nonworking landowning class to a low labor/land ratio in which the rules of the caste system
supported the institution of involuntary labor. The hypothesis is tested in two ways: longitudinally,
with data from ancient religious texts, and cross-sectionally, with twentieth-century statistics on
regional population/land ratios linked to anthropological measures of caste-system rigidity. Both the
longitudinal and cross-sectional evidence suggest that the labor/land ratio affected the caste
system’s development, persistence, and rigidity over time and across regions of India.
