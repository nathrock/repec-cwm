Title:  Controlling the Public Wage Bill in Portugal: 
The Case of University Professors



Abstract:  Public wages are a large share of the public budget in
Portugal and, therefore, hiring freezes are a central feature of the
efforts to control the public deficit. The system of public career
advancement, however, may lead to increases in the wage bill even in the
presence of hiring freezes. We estimate this wage drift effect in the
case of university professors. We use a logit analysis with 1999 census
data to identify the determinants of career advancement, to estimate the
employment distribution in previous years, and to obtain the
corresponding wage bill. We estimate that the annual wage drift is 2.6%,
a figure well above the GDP growth rate and, therefore, we conclude that
hiring freezes may be far from enough to stop the expansion of the
public wage bill.
