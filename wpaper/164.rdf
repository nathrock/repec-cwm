Title: An Alternative Reference Scenario for Global CO2Emissions
from Fuel Consumption: An ARFIMA Approach

Abstract: In this note, we establish an alternative reference scenario based on an ARFIMA estimated using
global CO2 emissions from 1750 to 2013. These new reference forecasts are free from additional
assumptions on demographic and economic variables, often used in most reference forecasts.
Instead, we only rely on the properties of the underlying stochastic process for global CO2
emissions that are, in this sense, closer to fundamentals. Our reference forecasts are clearly
below the levels proposed by other reference scenarios available in the literature. This is
important, as it suggests that the ongoing policy goals are actually easier to reach than what is
implied by the standard reference scenarios. Having lower and more realistic reference emissions
projections gives a truer assessment of the policy efforts that are needed, and highlights the lower
costs involved in mitigation efforts, thereby maximizing the likelihood of more widespread
environmental policy efforts.
