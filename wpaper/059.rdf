Title:  Predicting Health Behaviors with an Experimental Measure of Risk Preference



Abstract:  We conduct a large-scale economics experiment paired with a survey to examine the association between individual risk preference and health-related behaviors among adults aged 18 to 87 years. Risk preference is measured by the Holt and Laury (2002) lottery choice experiment.
Controlling for subject demographic and economic characteristics, we find that risk aversion is
negatively and significantly associated with cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, being overweight
or obese, and seat belt non-use. In additional specifications, we find that risk aversion is
negatively and significantly associated with the likelihood a subject engaged in any of five risky
behaviors and the number of risky behaviors reported.
