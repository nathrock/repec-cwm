Title:  Yes, Wall Street, There Is a January Effect! Evidence from Laboratory Auctions
Abstract:  In the first experimental test of the January effect, we find
an economically large and statistically significant result in two very
different auction environments. After controlling for variables that
could influence subjects’ bids such as differences in private values,
cumulative earnings, and learning effects, the prices in the January
markets were systematically higher than those in December.  The results
suggest that psychological factors may contribute to the well-documented
January effect in empirical stock market data, a conclusion that clearly
violates the efficient markets hypothesis.
