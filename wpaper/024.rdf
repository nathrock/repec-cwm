Title:  Graduation Rates and Accountability:  Regressions versus Production Frontiers

Abstract:  This paper suggests an alternative to the standard practice
of measuring the graduation rate performance using regression analysis. 
The alternative is production frontier analysis.  Production frontier
analysis is appealing because it compares an institutions graduation
rate to the best performance instead of the average performance.  The
paper explains the differences between these two types of analysis and
provides examples of their application using data for 187 national
universities.
