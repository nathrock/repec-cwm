Title:  On Migrant Selectivity


Abstract:  Recent migrants to the United States have displayed lower
earnings levels and a slower rate of earnings convergence with natives
than previous immigrants.  Borjas has argued that this reflects negative
selectivity of immigrants; others, including Card, Chiquiar and Hanson,
and Duleep and Regets, question this contention.  Some of the ambiguity
is due to measurement problems, with educational attainment (or its
labor market consequences) used in place of unobserved migrant quality. 
We suggest that constraints in the supply of education in sending
regions significantly limit the usefulness of educational attainment or
related measures as proxies for migrant quality.  We propose an
alternative measure of migrant quality that incorporates education
supply constraints, and present evidence of Mexican migrants
self-selecting positively on ability.
