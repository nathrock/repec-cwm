Title: 	Railroad Infrastructure Investments and Economic Development in the Antebellum United States


Abstract:  We measure the overall impact of railroad investment on economic development in the
antebellum period in the United States using a vector autoregressive approach. Our results can be
summarized as follows. First, we find bidirectional causality between railroad infrastructure
investment and GDP. Second, we estimate a marginal product of $4.2 for railroad investment
which corresponds to a 15.5% rate of return when considering a 10-year lifetime for railroad
capital. While about two-thirds of this effect stems from the supply side, short run demand side
effects also are substantial. Third, given the low effective tax rates practiced in the 1830s and the
magnitude of the effects of railroad investment we estimate, it is very likely that these
investments were not self-financing and may, therefore, have contributed to the high levels of
public indebtedness observed in the period.
