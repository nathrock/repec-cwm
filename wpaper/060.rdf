Title:  A Characterization of Strategy-Proof Rules over the Condorcet Domain with an Even Number of Individuals


Abstract:  For an odd number of individuals Campbell and Kelly [2] show that over the set of profiles that admit a strong Condorcet winner, majority rule is the only non-dictatorial strategy-proof social choice function. This paper shows that the situation is quite different in the case of an even number of individuals, and provides a characterization of strategy-proof social choice rules in this case.
