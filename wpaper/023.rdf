Title:  Israel, the Palestinian Factions, and the Cycle of Violence


Abstract:  In this study we extend our previous work to examine the
dynamic relationship between violence committed by Palestinian factions
and that committed by Israel during the Second Intifada. We find a
statistically significant relationship between Israeli fatalities
claimed by groups associated with the ruling political party, Fatah, and
subsequent Palestinian fatalities. We do not find a similar relationship
for Israeli fatalities claimed by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and
other Palestinian factions.  We conjecture that these differences are
due to the different positions of the factions vis-ˆ-vis bargaining over
a two-state solution to the conflict as well as the organizational
structures of the factions.
