Title: Country of Origin and Immigrant Earnings: Evidence from 1960-1990

Abstract:  Using 1960-1990 census microdata, this paper presents two analyses that examine how the initial
large differences in immigrant earnings by country of origin change with duration in the United
States. The first analysis reveals that country of origin adds less to the explanation of earnings
among adult male immigrants the longer they reside in the United States. A second
complementary analysis reveals a decrease with time in the United States in the earnings
dispersion of demographically comparable immigrants across countries of origin. Both results
imply convergence in immigrant earnings by country of origin.
We further test the sensitivity of these results to emigration bias—a potentially important,
though generally ignored problem in studies of immigrant earnings growth. A theoretical
analysis assesses the impact of hypothetical patterns of selective emigration on the two
convergence results. We then introduce a technique that could be generally applied as an
empirical test for emigration bias in immigrant studies. Both the theoretical and empirical
analyses suggest that immigrant earnings convergence by country of origin is not an artifact of
emigration.
