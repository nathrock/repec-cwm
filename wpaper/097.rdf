Title: The Stability and Growth Pact: Past Performance and Future Reforms

Abstract:  The ‘Stability and Growth Pact’ aims to constrain excessive fiscal deficits by member countries
in the European Monetary Union. It identifies and prescribes sanctions for countries that breach
the Maastricht deficit and debt ceilings. Under strong criticism for its apparent favoritism of
Germany and France, the SGP was reformed in 2005, after which its deficit procedures became
more responsive to the economic climate and were individualized to the country’s circumstances.
This paper explores the reformed SGP’s performance, especially in light of the recent Greek debt
and global financial crises, and proposes further changes to the Pact, while paying special
attention to political feasibility. In it we suggest reforms to the SGP that focus on national
ownership of fiscal discipline and an extension of Medium Term Objectives to include a
consideration of large external imbalances. We show that the latter can provide an early warning
signal for potential future difficulties for public finances.
