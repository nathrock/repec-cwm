Title:  Should You Turn Yourself In? The Consequences of Environmental Self-Policing

Abstract:  Facilities that self-police under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Audit Policy 
are eligible for reduced penalties on disclosed violations.  This paper investigates whether self- 
policing has additional consequences, in particular whether self-policing reduces future 
enforcement activity.  Using data on U.S. hazardous waste enforcement and disclosures, I find 
that facilities that self-police are rewarded with a lower probability of inspection in the future, 
although facilities with good compliance records may receive a smaller benefit than facilities 
with poor records.  Additionally, facilities that are inspected frequently are more likely to 
disclose than facilities that face a low probability of inspection. The results suggest that facilities 
may be able to strategically disclose in order to decrease future enforcement.
