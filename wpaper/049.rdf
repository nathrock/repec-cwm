Title:  Uniformly Bounded Information and Social Choice




Abstract:  The set of alternatives is infinite. If social welfare
function f satisfies the Pareto criterion and there is a positive number
&beta; such that each pair of alternatives can be socially ordered without
having to consult individual preference over a set with more than &beta;
alternatives then there are arbitrarily large finite subsets of X within
which f is dictatorial when individual preferences are restricted to a
rich subset of profiles.
