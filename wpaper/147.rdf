Title: A Quality-Preserving Increase in Four-Year College Attendance:
Evidence from NLS-72 and ELS:2002

Abstract:  We use the NLS-72 and ELS:2002 data sets to evaluate changes in the college matching process.
Rising attendance rates at four-year institutions have not decreased average preparedness of
college goers or of college graduates, and further attendance gains are possible before
diminishing returns sets in. We use multinomial logit models to demonstrate that measures of
likely success (GPA) became more predictive of college attendance over time, while other
student characteristics such as race and parents’ education became less predictive. Our evidence
suggests that schools have become better at sorting while students have efficiently responded to
changes in the return to higher education.
