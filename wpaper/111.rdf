Title: Private Policing of Environmental Performance: Does it Further Public Goals?


Abstract:  Over the past two decades the role of private parties in the policing of environmental regulation has
grown dramatically. In some cases the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has led the effort to
involve private parties, either formally or informally. In other situations, private parties have provided the
impetus for the new activities and the activities are, for the most part, conducted independently from
EPA. Private policing can be beneficial from a public policy perspective, as long as the increased
involvement of the private sector either decreases the overall costs of achieving a particular level of
environmental performance or increases environmental performance in a cost-effective manner. However,
private parties could also divert regulated entities away from regulatory objectives. This article explores
the privatization of environmental enforcement, presenting examples of six private programs and
activities and highlighting both the benefits and costs of these activities.
Some private activities do have a positive effect on environmental performance: EPA’s self-policing
policy has increased overall compliance while participation in the international environmental
certification program ISO 14001 is correlated with an increase in both compliance and environmental
performance more generally. However, studies of other private initiatives show that privatization can
have a deleterious effect on the achievement of regulatory goals. For example, an analysis of private
citizen suits finds that such suits decreases public enforcement rather than supplementing it. Additionally,
we have no real understanding of the effect of many private policing initiatives either because no analyses
have been conducted or because the existing studies do not focus on the effectiveness of such initiatives
in achieving regulatory goals. Although the examples cited in this article are not necessarily
representative of all private policing, the mixed evidence on the effectiveness of private sector
participation in environmental regulation does suggest the need for careful evaluation of these initiatives.
The article concludes by making a case for a more deliberate approach to evaluating the role of the private
sector in the enforcement of environmental regulation. I argue that before responding to continuing calls
to further privatize environmental regulation and enforcement, we must first determine whether existing
private participation is helping to achieve regulatory goals. Where it is not, we must modify the existing
initiatives, and potentially the underlying regulations and enforcement mechanisms as well, to maximize
their benefits. Only then should we look to expand the role of the private sector in the policing of
environmental regulations.
