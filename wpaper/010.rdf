Title:  State Higher Education Spending and the Tax Revolt
Abstract:  State policies resulting from the tax revolt of the late
1970s play an important role in determining the timing and magnitude of
the decline in state tax effort for higher education. An understanding
of the fiscal environment caused by these provisions is critical for the
future of state-supported higher education.
