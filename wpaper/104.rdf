Title: Management of Hazardous Waste and Contaminated Land



Abstract:  Regulation of hazardous waste and cleanup of contaminated sites are two major
components of modern public policy for environmental protection. We review the
literature on these related areas, with emphasis on empirical analyses. Researchers have
identified many behavioral responses to regulation of hazardous waste, including changes
in the location of economic activity. However, the drivers behind compliance with these
costly regulations remain a puzzle, as most research suggests a limited role for
conventional enforcement. Increasingly sophisticated research examines the benefits of
cleanup of contaminated sites, yet controversy remains about whether the benefits of
cleanup in the U.S. exceed its costs. Finally, research focusing on the imposition of legal
liability for damages from hazardous waste finds advantages and disadvantages of the U.S.
reliance on legal liability to pay for cleanup, as opposed to the government---financed
approaches more common in Europe.
