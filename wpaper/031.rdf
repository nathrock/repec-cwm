Title:  Monetary Policy, the Bond Market, and Changes in FOMC Communication Policy


Abstract:  Using high-frequency data in a Markov-switching framework, we
identify states that imply different responses of the yield curve to
unexpected changes in the federal funds target. Empirical estimates
reveal a low-volatility state where long-term bonds respond
significantly, and in a predictable manner, to unexpected changes in the
federal funds target. An alternative state exists with higher
volatility, where unexpected changes in the federal funds target raise
the short-end of the yield curve, but have no significant effect on the
long-end. The low-volatility state for long-term bonds occurs from
September 1995 to May 1999 and again from March 2000 to January 2002.
The timing of the switches between the two states for long-term bonds
coincides with changes in FOMC communication policy - though not all
changes in communications policy induce a switch.
