Title:  Poverty Trap in a Tributary Mode of Production: The Peasant Economy of Ethiopia
Abstract: The paradox of Ethiopia’s agrarian economy is that, despite
underwriting a world  civilization, the transition to an industrial
economy has eluded it. Using a model of AfroAsiatic tributarism, we
attribute this outcome to endemic extractive contests between a 
predominantly landed peasantry and a titled, prebendary overlord class. 
The latter’s strategy  of political accumulation inevitably engendered
immiserization of overlord and peasant alike  by privileging diversion
over production.  The surplus was then dissipated on unproductive 
consumption, national defence, and internecine strife.  Lacking a strong
state to mitigate  predation and political instability, the Ethiopian
peasant rationally ‘chose’ to be efficiently,  albeit self-sufficiently,
poor.
