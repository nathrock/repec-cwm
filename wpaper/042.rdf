Title:  Explaining Increases in Higher Education Costs

Abstract:  This paper presents new evidence on the conflict between two competing explanations of 
the increase in college costs, the cost disease theory of William Baumol and William 
Bowen and the revenue theory of cost of Howard Bowen.  Using cross section data, the 
paper demonstrates that the cost disease explanation dominates.
