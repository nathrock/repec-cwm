Title: The Elusive Concept of Immigrant Quality:
Evidence from 1970-1990 

Abstract:  The labor market "quality" of immigrants is a subject of debate among immigration
researchers, and a major public policy concern. However, traditional methods of measuring
human capital are particularly difficult to apply to recently arrived immigrants. Many factors that
have a negative effect on entry earnings also increase either the incentive or the opportunity for
faster human capital investment and earning growth. In addition, many country-of-origin
acquired skills that are not immediately valued in the U.S. labor market are useful to the
acquisition of U.S. skills. Thus entry earnings are not a good measure of the stock of immigrant
human capital.
This article presents a model of immigrant human capital investment and, using 1970-1990
census data, presents strong evidence of a systematic and important inverse relationship between
initial immigrant earnings and subsequent earnings growth. This result-which persists even after
accounting for differences in the immigration flows from different countries, sampling error, and the
effects of emigration - is fundamentally different from both earlier cross-sectional estimates and
more recent pooled models that constrain cohort growth rates to be equal. Although our model
provides theoretical support for an inverse relationship only when source country human capital is
held constant, faster earnings growth for low-entry-earnings immigrants is found empirically even
when age and education are not controlled for.
The immigrant human capital investment model presented here explores general principles
that may apply to other labor market transitions that involve skill transferability-including
occupational change and labor market reentry.
