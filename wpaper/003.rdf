Title:  Affirmative Action, Incentives and the Black-White Test Score Gap 
Abstract:  This  paper develops  a theoretical  model of  college admissions  to
study the effects of affirmative action policies on the high school  achievement
of college bound students. The innovation is to include endogenous human capital
decisions  in  the  model.  When  colleges  switch  admissions  policies,   they
implicitly alter the  likelihood of acceptance  earned by a  given human capital
investment.  Thus,  human  capital  investments  are  sensitive  to  changes  in
admissions  policies.  The  main results  are  that  banning affirmative  action
increases the black-white  test score gap  and decreases college  enrollment and
social welfare of the minority group.
