Title: ON THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF INVESTMENT IN RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURES IN PORTUGAL

Abstract:  The objective of this paper is to identify the effects of railroad infrastructure investment on aggregate and regional
economic performance in Portugal. At the aggregate level, we show that railroad investment crowds in private
investment and employment and have strong effects on output. At the regional level, we show that railroad
investment affects private investment positively in all regions, employment in only Lisbon and the North, and output
in all regions with the exception of Alentejo. The effects are regionally distributed in a rather uneven manner with
Lisbon and the North capturing the bulk of the effects. Our results also highlight the relevance of regional spillovers.
In terms of the relative effects of comparable railroad investment in the region and elsewhere in the country, we find
that the North and the Center benefit more from investment elsewhere while the remaining regions benefit more
from local investment. Finally, from a country-wide perspective, railroad investment located in Lisbon generates the
largest marginal benefits, which reflect, mostly, the large effects in the Lisbon region itself. By contrast, railroad
investment in the remaining regions has a much lower marginal benefit to the country, but these benefits reflect
mostly spillovers. This highlights the difficulty in implementing policies that simultaneously maximize aggregate
growth and reduce regional disparities.
