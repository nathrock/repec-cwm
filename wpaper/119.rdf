Title: Does Low Wealth Constrain Long-Distance Migration? Evidence from the NLSY79 Cohort

Abstract:  Although long-distance migration can be very beneficial, some families may have
too little wealth (or liquidity) to finance a move, which may involve direct transportation
costs and foregone earnings. I use individual-level longitudinal data (NLSY79)
to assess whether wealth holdings directly influence migration decisions in the U.S. I
focus on long-distance migration between labor markets, which imposes high migration
costs but offers potentially better labor market outcomes. Contrary to a liquidity
constraint story, I find consistently that plenty of people with low and even negative
wealth move, and that they are even more likely to move than people with higher
wealth holdings. The lack of a positive relationship between wealth and cross-labor
market migration remains in alternative subsets of respondents, controlling for many
household characteristics, in very flexible nonlinear models, and when using inheritance
income as an instrument for wealth.
