Title: The Relationship between Location Choice and
Earnings Inequality

Abstract:  This paper provides new empirical evidence about how workers’ locations affect
measurements of earnings inequality (and their changes over time) in the United
States. Part of the inequality observed in any given U.S. sample is due to the fact that
workers with different skills (and therefore earnings) are not distributed symmetrically
across locations that are more and less productive (and therefore pay higher
and lower wages). In particular, I estimate that a significant and rising proportion of
the college wage premium is due to college graduates living in and moving toward
higher-paying locations than high school graduates. Furthermore, I assess the impact
of location on real wage inequality (adjusting for local costs of living). The higher
wages that college graduates enjoy as a result of their location choices are mostly
counterbalanced by higher costs of living. From this, I infer that college graduates
choose to live in more economically productive labor markets than do workers with
less education, but college graduates are not necessarily more capable of exploiting
locational wage differences for their own advantage.
