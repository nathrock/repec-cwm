Title:  Green Cards and the Location Choices of Immigrants
in the United States, 1971-2000


Abstract:  This paper documents where immigrants who enter the U.S. with
different types of visas ("green cards") choose to live initially and
what determines those location choices.  Using population data on
immigrants from the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1971 to
2000, matched to data on state characteristics from the Integrated
Public Use Microsamples of the U.S. Census, I estimate conditional logit
models with the 48 contiguous U.S. states as the choice set. Like
previous researchers, I estimate that immigrants have a higher
probability of moving to states where individuals from their region of
birth represent a larger share of the state population, with relatives
of legal permanent residents responding most to this factor.  I also
find that, in general, immigrants in all admission categories respond to
labor market conditions when choosing where to live, but that these
effects were the largest for male employment-based immigrants and,
surprisingly, refugees.
