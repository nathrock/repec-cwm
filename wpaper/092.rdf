Title: The Geographic Distribution of Human Capital: Measurement of Contributing Mechanisms

Abstract:  This paper investigates how the geographic distribution of human capital evolves over time.
With U.S. data, I decompose generation-to-generation changes in local human capital into three
 factors: the previous generation’s human capital, intergenerational transmission of skills from
parents to their children, and migration of the children. I find evidence of regression to the mean
of local skills at the state level and divergence at the commuting zone level. Labor market size,
climate, local colleges, and taxes affect local skill measures. Skills move from urban to rural
labor markets through intergenerational transmission but from rural to urban labor markets
through migration.
