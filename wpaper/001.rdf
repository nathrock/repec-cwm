Title:  Recreational Fishing and the Benefits of Oyster Reef Restoration in  the
Chesapeake Bay  
Abstract:  In   this paper,   I use   a travel   cost model   of
recreation demand  to analyze  the economic  benefits to  the Bay's recreational
fishermen from  proposed oyster reef restoration programs.  The model explicitly
links  historical  oyster  bottom conditions  to recreational  fishing catch  to
capture ecosystem and  habitat benefits.  I  find that observed  catch is indeed
higher  in  areas   associated   with  higher    quality   reef   areas.    This
relationship  enables   the  estimation    of recreational   fishing  values for
improved  Bay habitat  since  fishermen value higher catches and restoration  of
oyster bottom will  lead to higher  quality reef areas  hence higher catch.   It
should be noted  that our model  provides a  reduced  form relationship  between
catch,  the underlying  fish population,  and habitat quality; however,   recent
work  show that  oyster bottom  provide  good  foraging habitat for a number  of
species and may therefore act as  attractors and  perhaps may  lead to    larger
numbers  of striped  bass in  the  future.   We find  that benefits from  oyster
reef restoration are measurable and can account for a substantial portion of the
costs of restoration.
