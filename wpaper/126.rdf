Title: Under the Cover of Darkness: Using Daylight Saving Time to Measure How Ambient Light Influences Criminal Behavior


Abstract:  We use data from the National Incidence-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to examine
how the probability of getting caught when committing a crime, proxied by ambient
daylight, impacts criminal activity. We exploit the existence of daylight saving time
(DST) to provide within-hour exogenous shockto daylight, using both the discontinuous
nature of DST as well as the 2007 extension of DST as sources of variation. Further, we
consider both crimes where darkness is likely to play a role in avoiding capture and
crimes where darkness would make little difference. Our preferred specification, a
regression discontinuity design, shows robbery rates decrease by an average of 51%
during the hour of sunset following the shift to DST in the spring. We also find large
drops in cases of reported murder (48%) and rape (56%). Effects are largest during the
hour of sunset prior to DST (i.e., the hour which was in darkness before but, post-DST,
is now light), suggesting changes are due to ambient light rather than other factors such
as increased police presence, and we find no changes in crimes where ambient light is
unlikely to be a factor. As an additional robustness check, we exploit the variation in the
impact of DST by hour and crime to repeat our analysis in a triple-difference framework
and show results are largely consistent. Using the social cost of crime, we estimate the
2007 spring extension of DST resulted in $558 million in avoided social costs of crime
per year, suggesting investment in lighting such as street lights could have high returns.
Finally, we consider if our findings are the result of increased criminal incapacitation or
deterrence of criminal behavior, and provide suggestive evidence the majority of the
effect is due to deterrence.
