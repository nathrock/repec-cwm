Title:  Self-Policing in a Targeted Enforcement Regime


Abstract:  This paper adds to the debate over whether self-policing can
increase environmental protection by considering an aspect of
self-policing that has been ignored in previous models Ð that
self-policing may influence future enforcement.  The model combines
self-policing with targeted enforcement and allows for both deliberate
and inadvertent violations.  As expected, rewarding self-policers with
more lenient future enforcement increases auditing, remediation, and
disclosure of inadvertent violations.  Self-policing can also serve as a
complement to deliberate compliance and can thus further increase
environmental performance.  However, under reasonable conditions
self-policing can be a substitute for deliberate compliance and could
therefore be detrimental to environmental protection.
