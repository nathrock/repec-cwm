Title:  One for Some or One for All? Taylor Rules and Interregional Heterogeneity



Abstract:  We document a novel empirical phenomenon: the U.S. Federal Reserve appears
to set interest rates partly in response to regional economic disparities. This result is
remarkably robust even after controlling for a wide variety of factors, including the
central bank’s information set and a battery of explanatory variables. We argue that this
finding likely does not reflect an explicit concern about regional differences on the part of
policymakers but instead can be explained by a model with non-linear regional Phillips
curves. Consistent with the predictions of this model, we find that the Federal Reserve
responds disproportionately to fluctuations in low unemployment states. Alternative
explanations based on differential effects of monetary policy across regions or regional
preferences on the part of voting members of the FOMC cannot account for this finding.
