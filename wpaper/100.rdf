Title: SPATIAL MISMATCH, IMMIGRANT NETWORKS, AND HISPANIC EMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

Abstract:  We study the relationship between Hispanic employment and location-specific measures of the
distribution of jobs. We find that it is only the local density of jobs held by Hispanics that matters for
Hispanic employment, that measures of local job density defined for Hispanic poor English speakers or
immigrants are more important, and that the density of jobs held by Hispanic poor English speakers are
most important for the employment of these less-skilled Hispanics than for other Hispanics. This evidence
is consistent with labor market networks being an important influence on the employment of less-skilled
Hispanics, as is evidence from other sources. We also find that in MSAs where the growth rates of the
Hispanic immigrant population have been highest, which are also MSAs with historically low Hispanic
populations, localized job density for low-skilled jobs is even more important for Hispanic employment
than in the full sample. We interpret this evidence as consistent with the importance of labor market
networks, as strong labor market networks are likely to have been especially important in inducing
Hispanics to migrate, and because of these networks employment in these “new immigrant” cities is
especially strongly tied to the local availability of jobs.
