Title:  When I'm 104: The Determinants Of Healthy Longevity among the 
Oldest-Old in China 
 



Abstract:  This study uses the China Healthy Longevity Survey of Oldest-Old to investigate 
the health status of the oldest-old in China.  We found that the different measures of 
health collected in the survey were only moderately related.  That is, there is not a single 
construct called "health".  We found that work history was modestly related to some 
measures of health.  We also found that childhood health and socioeconomic status were 
correlated with health even at advanced ages.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first study to examine this connection in developing countries and at such advanced ages.
