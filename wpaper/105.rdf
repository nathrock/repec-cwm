Title: What is it going to take to achieve 2020 Emission Targets?
Marginal abatement cost curves and the budgetary impact of CO2 taxation in Portugal (



Abstract:  The objective of this paper is to study CO2 taxation in its dual role as a climate
and fiscal policy instrument. It develops marginal abatement cost curves for CO2
emissions using a dynamic general equilibrium model of the Portuguese economy
which highlights the mechanisms of endogenous growth and includes a detailed
modeling of the public sector. It also considers complementary cost curves
corresponding to the impact of CO2 taxes on GDP and on the public budget.
Simulation results show that a tax of 17.00 Euros per tCO2 has the capacity to
limit emissions to 62.6 Mt CO2 in 2020, consistent with the existing climate policy
target for Portugal. In turn, changes in tax revenues, together with reductions in
public spending, lead to a 2.7% decline in public debt. These desirable outcomes
come at the cost of a 0.7% reduction in GDP. In general, stricter emission targets
imply greater equilibrium CO2 tax levels and larger GDP losses, although these
are accompanied by greater reductions in public debt. Finally, the paper
highlights the importance of public spending behavior for projecting the impact of
CO2 taxes on public revenues and the public account and designing policies to
promote fiscal consolidation.
