Title: A New Carbon Tax in Portugal: A Missed Opportunity to Achieve the Triple Dividend?

Abstract:  In 2014, the Portuguese government appointed a Commission for Environmental Tax Reform that
formulated a carbon-tax proposal designed to achieve three dividends: to help Portugal meet the
European Union’s target for emissions reductions by 2030, to boost long-term employment and
GDP above their pre-carbon-tax levels, and to strengthen public finances by lowering public
indebtedness. A key feature of this proposal was a judicious set of mixed strategies to recycle all
carbon-tax revenues back into the economy. In this note, we show how the carbon tax that the
Portuguese Parliament eventually approved deviated from such guidelines, and ultimately failed to
achieve the triple dividend. We argue that authorities need to quickly amend the existing legislation
to avoid this misguided attempt turning into a missedopportunityto improve environmental,
macroeconomic, and fiscal outcomes.
