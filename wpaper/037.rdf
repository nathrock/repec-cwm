Title: ON THE ECONOMIC AND BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF INVESTMENTS IN SCUTS -THE PORTUGUESE TOLL-FREE HIGHWAYS



Abstract: This paper provides empirical evidence on the economic and budgetary effects of the recent
investments in toll-free highways in Portugal, the so-called SCUTS, in an effort to bring some
clarity to the current policy debate on these highways. This debate is centered on the issue of the
financial sustainability of these highways for the public sector and is derived from the fact that
their financing through public-private partnerships and shadow tolls involves regular payments
from the public budget to the private firms operating them. In this context, the introduction of
tolls has been suggested as a mechanism to alleviate possible budgetary pressures.

Our first main conclusion is that investments in SCUTS have positive economic effects in all
regions of the country. Furthermore, we find that regional spillovers account for about threequarters
of the total effects of these investments. A paradigmatic case is Lisbon, a region that
captures the greatest share of these effects without any investments having actually occurred in
the region itself. Our second main conclusion is that investments in SCUTS do not seem to
generate problems of financial sustainability for the public budget. We estimate that for all
SCUTS, the equilibrium tax rate, i.e., the rate that would balance the tax revenues induced by
these highways and the shadow tolls the government has to pay, is lower than the effective tax
rate for the economy. As a corollary and from a policy standpoint our results suggest that the
introduction of tolls is questionable from a conceptual perspective due to the magnitude of
spillovers and seems to be unnecessary from a financial perspective.
