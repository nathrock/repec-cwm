Title:  Business as usual: Politicians with business experience, government
budgets, and policy outcomes


Abstract:  Are budget and policy outcomes different under politicians with business experience?
We study California city councils and implement a regression discontinuity strategy to provide
causal evidence on this issue. Ultimately, we find no evidence that the election of a candidate
with business experience has an impact on city expenditures, revenues, debt ratios,
unemployment rates, and other outcomes. Future vote shares for candidates with business
experience are also unaffected, which suggests that businesspersons are not having an impact
that is observed to voters but unobserved in our data. We find weak evidence that the election of
a businessperson may lead to lower borrowing costs.
