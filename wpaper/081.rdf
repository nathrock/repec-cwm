Title: SOCIAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN PORTUGAL: AFTER ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID AND DONE HOW MUCH HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED?



Abstract: This paper provides an empirical estimate of the macroeconomic effects of the Portuguese payas-
you-go social security system based on data for the period 1970-2007 and on VAR estimates
using GDP, the unit cost of labor, the unemployment rate, the savings rate and social security
spending. The major findings are twofold. First, growing social security spending has had
detrimental effects on all of the private sector variables under consideration suggesting the
existence of sizable inefficiencies. Second, these inefficiencies persist despite the successive
reforms that took place over the last two decades. As a corollary, these results highlight the need
for structural reforms of the pay-as-you-go system thereby addressing the sources of
inefficiencies in addition to dealing with its chronic sustainability problems.
