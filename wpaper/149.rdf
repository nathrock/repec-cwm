Title: Bilateral Linkages and the International Transmission of Business Cycles


Abstract: This paper estimates the contributions of trade and financial linkages to the directed graph that describes the international propagation of macroeconomic shocks at the business cycle frequency. Among the findings: import and export intensity are asymmetrically associated with shock transmission; bilateral portfolio equity holdings are associated with comovement within the quarter but not between quarters; the import of goods used for capital formation is strongly associated with shock transmission both within and between quarters. The novel stylized facts refine the “trade-comovement” puzzle into the “trade-correlation” and the “trade-transmission puzzles, both of which are challenges for standard international business cycle models.
