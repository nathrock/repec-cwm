Title: 	ON THE LONG-TERM MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES



Abstract:  We estimate the long-term impact of changes in social security and social protection spending on
economic performance in the USA. We estimate a VAR model relating GDP, unemployment
rates, saving rates, and social spending. Our results suggest that social spending has significant
distortionary effects in the labor markets as measured by its long term effects on the
unemployment rate, which translate into a detrimental effect on long-term output, this despite a
positive, albeit small, effect on the gross savings rate. There are important policy implications of
these results. If one considers the systems as they are, any further expansion in their generosity
would have detrimental long-term effects. These detrimental effects, however, are neither an
indictment of social spending or evidence against extension of benefits. What they highlight is
the need to carefully consider the financing mechanisms currently used and the need to align
benefits and contributions in the pension component of social security and the need to find a taxrevenue
mix that is less distortionary for the unfunded benefits.
