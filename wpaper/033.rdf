Title:  On the Economic and Fiscal Effects of Investment in Road Infrastructure in Portugal


Abstract:  The objective of this paper is to investigate the economic and fiscal impact of road infrastructure
investment in Portugal, focusing on the effects for each administrative region of both local
investments and investments in other regions. We estimate VAR models for the national
economy as well as for each of the five regions and using the associated impulse-response
functions we find that investment in road infrastructures has been a powerful instrument to
increase private investment, to create new permanent jobs and to promote long-term growth in
all regions. More importantly, investment in road infrastructure, both at the aggregate level and
for each one of the five regions, generates fiscal effects that largely exceed the initial investment
itself. Accordingly, there is no trade-off in the long-term between the potentially positive
economic effects and the potentially negative budgetary effects of such investments, i.e., both
economic and budgetary effects are positive. As a corollary, policies that would reduce current
road investment as a response to the current budgetary concerns will result in lower long-term
growth as well as worse budgetary conditions in the future.
