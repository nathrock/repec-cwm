Title:  Pareto, Anonymity, and Independence: Four Alternatives 



Abstract:  For four alternatives and an even number of individuals, we
prove a conjecture in a companion paper: It is impossible for a social
choice rule to satisfy all of (1) Pareto, (2) anonymity, (3) full
domain, and (4) independence of some alternative, a relaxation of
Arrow’s IIA.
