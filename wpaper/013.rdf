Title:  The Diversified Business Group as an Innovative Organizational Model 
for Large State-Enterprise Reform in China and Vietnam
Abstract: The diversified business group (DBG) is a ubiquitous
institution in developing economies. It is a formal inter-firm network
that typically involves financial institutions, distributors and
manufacturers. Groupwise diversification is viewed by some as a novel
form of organizational innovation by entrepreneurial tycoons while
others see it as an instrument for rent seeking. Inspired by Korean
chaebols but chastened by Russian financial-industrial groups, China and
Vietnam are creating business groups out of state enterprises.  After
reviewing the theory and cross-country experience, this paper concludes
that selective economic grouping can be an efficient transitional
organization.  DBGs can facilitate government monitoring, exploitation
of scale economies for scarce managerial talent, better risk management,
and realization of network and scope economies.  Success in incubating
national champions is, however, predicated on a high technocratic
capability for restraining  abuse of market power, nurturing competitive
market institutions, properly sequencing large scale privatization, and
crafting WTO-compatible industrial and technology policies.
