Title: Are Wage Premiums for Black Women Illusory? A Critical Examination

Abstract:  Recent evidence documents a wage premium for black women (e.g., Fryer, 2011). However, we
find no strong evidence of a premium after accounting for selection into the labor market; years
of education attained, conditional on ability; and local cost of living. We find modest evidence of
heterogeneous effects by education-small premiums for highly educated black women and
penalties for black women with less education. Controlling for actual experience yields estimates
at the low end of previously published premiums, but the possibility of discrimination in hiring
and firing implies that controls for actual experience may be inappropriate.
