Title: The Persistence of Self-Employment Across Borders: New Evidence on Legal Immigrants to the United States

Abstract:  Using recently-available data from the New Immigrant Survey, we find that previous self-employment experience in an immigrant’s country of origin is an important determinant of their
self-employment status in the U.S., increasing the probability of being self-employed by about 7
percent. Our results improve on the previous literature by measuring home-country selfemployment
directly rather than relying on proxy measures. We find little evidence to suggest
that home-country self-employment has a significant effect on U.S. wages in either paid
employment or self employment.
