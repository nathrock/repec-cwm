Title:  Arrest Avoidance: Law Enforcement and Price of Cocaine


Abstract:  Contrary to one goal of drug law enforcement, cocaine prices
decreased between the years 1986 and 2000. This paper discusses how
arrest avoidance behavior can affect cocaine consumer and dealer
response to law enforcement. Dealers may avoid arrest by incurring quick
and easy sales; thus pure gram price is negatively related to dealer
enforcement. Consumers avoid arrest by accepting high prices rather than
search for lower prices. Thus pure gram price is increasing in consumer
enforcement. Because the implications from arrest avoidance conflict
with traditional models of how enforcement should affect prices, I study
the relationship using empirical analysis. Using purchase level data
from the Drug Enforcement Administration and legal penalty data, I find
a negative and significant relationship between dealer enforcement and
pure gram price, which is consistent with the intuition of arrest
avoidance.
