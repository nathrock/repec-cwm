Title: Do Global CO2 Emissions from Fossil-Fuel Consumption
Exhibit Long Memory? A Fractional Integration Analysis

Abstract: In this paper we use an ARFIMA approach to measure the degree of fractional integration of
aggregate world CO2 emissions and its five components – coal, oil, gas, cement, and gas flaring.
We find that all variables are stationary and mean reverting, but exhibit long-term memory.
With aggregate CO2 emissions as a reference, our results suggest that both coal and oil
combustion emissions have the weakest degree of long-range dependence, while emissions
from gas, and gas flaring have the strongest. With evidence of long memory, we conclude that
transitory policy shocks are likely to have long-lasting effects. Although the effects of any
active policy on CO2 emissions take longer to disappear, they preserve their temporary nature.
Accordingly, permanent effects on CO2 emissions require a more permanent policy stance. In
this context, if one were to rely only on testing for stationarity and non-stationarity, one would
likely conclude in favor of non-stationarity, and therefore that even transitory policy shocks
have permanent effects. Our fractional integration analysis highlights that this is not the case.
