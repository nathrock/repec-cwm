Title: Inequality and Public Good Provision: An Experimental Analysis
Abstract:  Recent studies report that economic inequality is associated
with reduced government expenditures on social programs.  Several
prominent social scientists, including Putnam [2000], attribute this
relationship to the detrimental “psychosocial effects” of group
heterogeneity on cooperation.  We test the hypothesis that inequality
within a group reduces individual contributions in a canonical public
goods experiment.  Unlike previous examinations of inequality and public
good provision, our design introduces inequality by manipulating the
levels and distributions of fixed payments given to subjects for
participating in the experiment.  When made salient through public
information about each individual’s standing within the group,
inequality in the distribution of fixed payments reduces contributions
to the public good for all group members.
