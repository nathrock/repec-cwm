Title: Environmental Fiscal Reform and Fiscal Consolidation:
The Quest for the Third Dividend in Portugal

Abstract:  This paper explores the capacity for environmental fiscal reform to reduce CO2
emissions, stimulate economic performance, and promote fiscal sustainability.
Simulation results suggest that reforms based on CO2 taxation stimulate GDP
when tax revenues are used to promote private or public investment and stimulate
employment when used to finance reductions in personal income taxation or
firms' social security contributions. More generally, reforms allow for reductions
in the costs of climate policy, a weaker realization of the second dividend. In
addition, several reforms lead to reductions in public debt, the realization of a
third dividend. When political constraints on reducing public spending are
considered, however, this third dividend only materializes when revenues finance
public investment or reductions in the firms' social security contributions.
Overall, our results suggest that low growth and high public debt need not be
regarded as hindrances for environmental fiscal reform but can actually be seen
as catalysts.
