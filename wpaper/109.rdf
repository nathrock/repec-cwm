Title: Final energy demand in Portugal: How persistent it is and why it matters for environmental policy*



Abstract:  The objective of this paper is to analyze the degree of persistence of final energy demand in
Portugal. Our results suggest the presence of a strong level of persistence at the aggregate level
with demand for gas as the most persistent component and demand for coal as the least
persistent. In turn, final demands for petroleum and biomass have levels of persistence similar to
aggregate demand. The case of electricity is inconclusive. These results have important
implications for the design of environmental policy. First, the fact that final energy demand is
highly persistent means that the effects of environmental policies will tend to be long lasting.
Second, the high persistence of gas and the fact that biomass and petroleum have levels of
persistence that are similar suggests that fuel switching policies will be relatively easy to
implement in these cases. Switching away from coal, however, may not be easy. Finally, the case
of electricity is ambiguous.
