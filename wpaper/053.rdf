Title:  Avoiding Tunnel Vision in the Study of Higher Education Costs

Abstract:  Much of the literature on the causes of rising costs in higher education focuses on specific features and pathologies of decision-making within colleges and universities.  We argue that this inward-looking focus on the specifics of higher education as an industry is a form of tunnel vision that can lead to poor public policy decisions.  In this paper we show that cost disease and capital-skill complementarity are two crucially important causes of rising costs in higher education.  These two economy-wide forces are something higher education shares with other skilled-labor-intensive services.
