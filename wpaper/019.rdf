Title:  Can Consumers Enforce Environmental Regulations? The Role of the Market in Hazardous Waste Compliance

Abstract:  To assess the role that consumers can play in encouraging
environmental compliance, we examine the U.S. hazardous waste management
industry to determine (1) whether environmental performance affects
consumer demand and (2) whether markets affect compliance behavior. We
find that noncompliance does decrease demand, at least in the
short-term. While we do not find any evidence that market size affects
compliance, local competition does appear to increase compliance.
However, as competition becomes less localized, it has a smaller, if
any, effect. Finally, regardless of the pressures exerted by consumers
to comply, commercial managers are more likely to violate than on-site
managers.
