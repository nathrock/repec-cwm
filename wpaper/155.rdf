Title: Achieving the Triple Dividend in Portugal:
A Dynamic General-Equilibrium Evaluation
of a Carbon Tax Indexed to Emissions Trading

Abstract:  Using an applied dynamic general-equilibrium model, we simulate the environmental,
economic, and budgetary effects in Portugal of a new carbon tax indexed to the carbon price in the
EU-ETS market. Through careful recycling of the carbon-tax revenues to finance lower personal
income taxes, lower Social Security contributions, and higher investment tax credits - in particular
when these changes are directed at promoting energy efficiency - we show that a carbon tax reform
can yield three dividends of a long-lasting nature: a reduction in emissions, better economic
performance, and a stronger budgetary position. Thus, we show that it is possible to design a
politically-feasible carbon tax reform that not only boosts economic growth and strengthens fiscal
consolidation, but also accommodates the legitimate needs of different stakeholders: interest groups
that target environmental goals, households focused distributional issues, and businesses concerned
with international competitiveness. These views were fully incorporated in a draft bill presented to
the Portuguese Government in September 2014 by the Commission for Environmental Tax Reform
[CRFV (2014)]. Based on these recommendations, a new indexed carbon tax was then approved by
Parliament, and enacted on January 1st, 2015.
