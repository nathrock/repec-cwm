Title:  An Experimental Study of the Effects of Inequality and Relative
Deprivation  on Trusting Behavior
Abstract:  Several non-experimental studies report that income
inequality and other forms of population-based heterogeneity reduce
levels of trust in society.  However, recent work by Glaeser et al.
(2000) calls into question the reliability of widely used survey-based
measures of trust.  Specifically, survey responses regarding trust
attitudes did not reflect subjects' actual behavior in a trust game.  In
this paper, we conduct a novel experimental test of the effects of
inequality on trust and trustworthiness. Our experimental design induces
inequality by varying the show-up fees paid to subjects, in contrast to
previous experiments that focus on broad cultural or national
differences in trust.  We do not find robust support for the hypothesis
that inequality per se dampens trusting behavior among all subjects;
however, we do find some evidence that trust and trustworthiness are
influenced by an individual's relative position in the group.  Finally,
we confirm previous findings that common survey-based  measures of
social trust are not associated with actual trusting behavior.
