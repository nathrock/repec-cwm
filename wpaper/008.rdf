Title:  Revealed Preference for Car Tax Cuts:  An Empirical Study of Perceived Fiscal Incidence
Abstract:  Voting in an election in which elimination of the local car tax is the central issue shows how a
highly visible universal tax cut can prevail in the electoral process even if benefits are skewed
toward upper income households. These results are consistent with positive models of fiscal
structure choice in which fiscal systems are the consequence of support maximizing politicians
attempting to supply net benefits to easily identifiable interest groups without generating significant
opposition from other groups.
