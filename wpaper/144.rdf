Title: Will Additional Federal Enforcement Improve
the Performance of Pipelines in the U.S.?



Abstract: This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the effectiveness of regulatory enforcement in
increasing the environmental and safety performance of U.S. natural gas and hazardous liquid
pipeline operators. The analysis combines data on federal regulatory inspections, enforcement
actions, and penalties with data on injuries, fatalities, property damage, and barrels of product
lost through pipeline "incidents" for 2006-2011 for the 344 largest pipeline operators in the U.S.
The results of the analysis do not provide compelling evidence that either federal inspections or
civil penalties are particularly effective in increasing performance; however, the number of
federal cases initiated against an operator does have a significant effect on many forms of
performance, although not for incidents in general. The results also suggest that some targeting
of federal enforcement resources is based on past performance, but there may be room for even
more effective targeting. Finally, the analysis reveals interesting patterns between state and
federal enforcement efforts.
