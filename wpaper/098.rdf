Title: Donor Policies, Industry Structure, and the Global Allocation of Electrification Aid, 1970-2001

Abstract:  Access to electricity is widely recognized as an essential element of economic development. This
paper uses a comprehensive dataset on electrification aid projects to quantify and model the
determinants of multilateral and bilateral electrification aid in the last three decades of the 20th
century. Total annual electrification aid fluctuated substantially over the period. While
multilateral and bilateral donors were relatively concentrated, aid recipients were widely
dispersed. Our major finding is that electrification aid by the 1990s had moved marginally
toward poorer countries, except for those in Africa, and toward countries with better governance
structures and ones that had restructured their electric power sector. This likely reflected the
liberalization and privatization policies affecting the industry from the mid-1980s on.
