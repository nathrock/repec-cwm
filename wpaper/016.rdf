Title:  Production and Gains from Trade

Abstract:  This paper describes a classroom game in which students make
production and trade decisions. Each student represents a country and
decides how much of two goods to produce, how much to exchange with a
partner country, and whether to specialize in the production of one of
the two goods. In introductory level classes, the game helps students
understand the notion of comparative advantage in production and
distinguish between gains from pure exchange and gains from
specialization and trade. Class discussion focuses on the concepts of
production possibility frontier, marginal productivity of inputs, and on
the determination of the price ratio at which trade may occur. In
advanced classes, the exercise facilitates comparisons among different
models of international trade and serves as a platform from which to
introduce and discuss key issues in current research and public debate.
