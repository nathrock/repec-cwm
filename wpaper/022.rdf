Title:  The Cycle of Violence? An Empirical Analysis of 
Fatalities in the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict


Abstract:  This paper studies the dynamics of violence in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict since the outbreak of the Second (or
"Al-Aqsa") Intifada in September 2000, during which more than 3,300
Palestinians and more than 1,000 Israelis have been killed.  The
conflict has followed an uneven pattern, with periods of high levels of
violence and periods of relative calm. Using data on the number of
deaths occurring each day between September 2000 and January 2005, we
estimate reaction functions for both Israelis and Palestinians and find
evidence of unidirectional Granger causality from Palestinian violence
to Israeli violence, but not vice versa.  This finding is consistent
whether we look only at the incidence of fatalities or whether we look
at the level of fatalities, and is robust to the specification of the
lag structure and the level of time aggregation. We find little evidence
that violence on either side has a direct deterrent or incapacitation
effect. We do find, however, that successful assassination attempts do
reduce the number of subsequent Israeli fatalities. We conclude that,
despite the popular perception that Palestinians and Israelis are
engaged in "tit-for-tat" violence, there is no evidence to support that
notion.
