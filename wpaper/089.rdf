Title: The Predictive Content of Commodity Futures


Abstract:  This paper examines the relationship between spot and futures prices for a broad range of
commodities, including energy, precious and base metals, and agricultural commodities. In
particular, we examine whether futures prices are (1) an unbiased and/or (2) accurate predictor of
subsequent spot prices. While energy futures prices are generally unbiased predictors of future
spot prices, there is much stronger evidence against the null for other commodity markets. This
difference appears to be driven in part by the depth of each market. We find that over the last
five years, it is much harder to reject the null of futures prices being unbiased predictors of future spot prices than in earlier periods for almost all commodities. In addition, futures prices do approximately as well as a random walk in forecasting future spot prices, and vastly outperform
a reduced form empirical model.
