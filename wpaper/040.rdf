Title:  Public Investment, Economic Performance and Budgetary Consolidation: 
VAR Evidence for the 12 Euro Countries



Abstract:  In a period of heightened concern about fiscal consolidation
in the euro area a politically expedient way of controlling the public
budget is to cut public investment. A critical question, however, is
whether or not political expediency comes at a cost, in terms of both
long-term economic performance and future budgetary contention efforts.
First, common wisdom suggests that public investments have positive
effects on economic performance although the empirical evidence is less
clear. Second, it is conceivable that public investment has such strong
effects on output, that over time it generates enough additional tax
revenues to pay for itself. Obviously, it is equally plausible that the
effects on output although positive are not strong enough for the public
investment to pay for itself. In this paper we investigate these issues
empirically for the twelve countries in the euro area using a vector
auto-regressive approach. We conclude that the euro countries can be
gathered in four groups according to the nature of the economic and
budgetary impact of public investment. The first group includes Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, and Netherlands, where the economic effects are
either negative or positive but very small and, therefore, cuts will be
harmless for the economy and effective from a budgetary perspective. The
second group includes Finland, Portugal, and Spain, where public
investment does not pay for itself and, therefore, cuts are an effective
tool of budgetary consolidation although they are harmful for the
economy. The third group includes France, Greece, and Ireland where
public investment just pays for itself and therefore cuts are not an
effective way of achieving long-term budgetary consolidation and are
harmful for the economy.  Finally, the fourth group includes Germany and
Italy, where public investment more than pays for itself and, therefore,
cuts are not only harmful for the economy but also counterproductive
from a budgetary perspective.
