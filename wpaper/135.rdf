Title: The Economic Status of Asian Americans Before and After
the Civil Rights Act

Abstract:  In contrast to their relative standing in today’s labor market, in 1960 U.S.-born men in all Asian
groups earned substantially less than comparable whites. We explore explanations for the wage gap
and find that all of the variables that might plausibly account for it, such as Asian/white differences
in schooling, labor force participation, entrepreneurial and agricultural employment, English
proficiency, enclave activity, and foreign-born parentage, have either no effect or only modest
effects on the 1960 wage gap and its subsequent reduction. Our findings suggest that anti-Asian
labor market discrimination was the predominate cause of the 1960 wage gap and that most of the
1960 to 1980 improvement in the relative wages of U.S.-born Asian men stemmed from a decline in
anti-Asian discrimination. Although much of the policy focus of the civil rights era was directed at
reducing discrimination against blacks, our findings suggest a prominent post-Civil Rights Act labor
market effect for Asians. If these results hold up to further scrutiny, one interpretation is that the
Civil Rights Act and accompanying activities, and/or concomitant changes in societal attitudes,
benefited all minorities.
