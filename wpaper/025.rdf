Title:  A Spatial Model of Dolphin Avoidance in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean

Abstract:  This paper examines the impact of dolphin-safe eco-labeling
and how it fundamentally altered the spatial distribution of fishing
effort and fishermen's willingness to pay to avoid dolphins.  To do
this, a dynamic discrete choice econometric model is applied to the
Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna fishery. This econometric approach
combines a dynamic programming component with the static discrete site
choice model.  This estimator couples the current period projected
profits associated with fishing a specific site with the value of all
future location choices on the cruise, assuming choices are made
optimally.  The key feature of this model is that it recovers behavioral
parameters and solves the dynamic programming problem recursively.  The
dynamic site choice model reveals a markedly higher impact on producers
as compared to the commonly used static model following the labeling
regime.  Further, in all but a few cases the common practice in dynamic
choice models of setting discount factors equal to one is rejected.
