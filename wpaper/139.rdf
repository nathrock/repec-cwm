Title: Okun's Law across the Business Cycle and during the Great Recession: A Markov Switching Analysis


Abstract:  The substantial increase in unemployment during the Great Recession, coupled with the
possibility of a breakdown in Okun's law, gave rise to concerns of a structural increase in the
natural rate of unemployment. We estimate asymmetries in Okun's law using quarterly data from
1948:01-2012:04 across the business cycle as defined by exogenous breaks for the period after
the peak of the business cycle to the trough. We further allow for endogenous break points by
estimating a markov switching model. The estimated asymmetries rely on adequate specification
of the dynamics of the relationship. The non-linearities in Okun's law provide strong support for
an understanding of deviations in Okun's law during the Great Recession as a natural by-product
of a stronger relationship between GDP growth during contractions than recoveries, although this
fails to explain the entirety of the weak labor market conditions during the tepid recovery in
economic activity. This similarly contributes towards an understanding of the phenomena of
jobless recoveries which are a product of weak economic growth in recent decades coupled with
a weaker relationship between GDP growth and unemployment during expansions. In this
respect, the Great Recession, despite the relatively larger contraction in economic activity, was
no different from previous recessions.
