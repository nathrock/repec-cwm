Title: Integrated technological-economic modeling platform for
energy and climate policy analysis

Abstract:  Computable general equilibrium (CGE) and bottom-up models each have unique strengths and weakness
in evaluating energy and climate policies. This paper describes the development of an integrated
technological, economic modelling platform (HYBTEP), built through the soft-link between the bottomup
TIMES and the CGE GEM-E3 models. HYBTEP combines cost minimizing energy technology
choices with macroeconomic responses, which is essential for energy-climate policy assessment.
HYBTEP advances on other hybrid tools by assuming ‘full-form’ models, integrating detailed and
extensive technology data with disaggregated economic structure, and ‘full-link’, i.e., covering all
 economic sectors. Using Portugal as a case study, we examine three scenarios: i) the current energyclimate
policy, ii) a CO2 tax, and iii) renewable energy subsidy, with the objective of assessing the
advantages of HYBTEP vis-à-vis bottom-up approach. Results show that the economic framework in
HYBTEP partially offsets the increase or decrease in energy costs from the policy scenarios, while
TIMES sets a wide range of results, dependent of energy services-price elasticities. HYBTEP allows the
computation of the economic impacts of policies while considers technological detail. Moreover, the
hybrid platform increases the transparency of policy analysis by making explicit the mechanisms through
which energy demand evolves, resulting in high confidence for decision-making.
