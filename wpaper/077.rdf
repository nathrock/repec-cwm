Title:	How Green is Your Campus? An Analysis of the Factors that Drive Universities to Embrace Sustainability



Abstract:  I examine the factors that influence the adoption of sustainable practices by institutions of higher
education (IHEs) in the U.S. Using data from the Sustainable Endowments Institute, I conduct an
ordered probit analysis on 180 IHEs. The results show that size and wealth are significant factors
in the adoption of sustainable practices and that stakeholders such as faculty, alumni, and the
surrounding community also play an important role. I find no evidence that institutions adopt
sustainability to attract students. Also, in contrast to the findings of similar studies on for-profit
entities, there is no evidence that regulatory pressures encourage campus sustainability. I also
examine the factors that affect the institutions’ decision to sign the Presidents Climate
Commitment (PCC), a largely symbolic gesture. The results for the PCC are quite different than
those for overall sustainability. Most importantly, neither wealth or size are significant factors in
that decision.
