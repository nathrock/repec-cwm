Title:  Organ Transplants, Hiring Committees, and Early Rounds 
of the Kappell Piano Competition

Abstract:  Function g selects exactly k alternatives as a function of 
the preferences of n individuals. It cannot be manipulated by any individual, 
assuming that an individual prefers set A to B whenever A can be obtained 
from B by eliminating some alternatives and replacing each with a preferred 
alternative. Then there is someone whose k top-ranked alternatives are always 
selected if: (i). k = 2 and n $ 2; or (ii). k = 3 and n = 2; or (iii). k > 3, 
n = 2, and g has a unanimity property; or (iv). k > 2, n $ 2, g has a unanimity 
property, and no coalition can manipulate.
