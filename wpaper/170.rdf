Title: Updated Reference Forecasts
for Global CO2 Emissions from Fossil-Fuel Consumption

Abstract: We provide alternative reference forecasts for global CO2 emissionsbased on an ARFIMA model estimated with
annual data from 1750 to 2014. These forecasts are free from additional assumptions on demographic and economic
variables that are commonly used in reference forecasts, as they only rely on the properties of the underlying
stochastic process for CO2emissions, as well ason all the observed information it incorporates. In this sense, these
forecasts are morebased on fundamentals. Our reference forecast suggests that in 2030, 2040 and 2050, in the
absence of any structural changes of any type, CO2would likely be at about 23.1%, 29.1% and 33.7% above 2010
emission levels, respectively. These values are clearly below the levels proposed by other reference scenarios
available in the literature.This is important, as it suggests that the ongoing policy goals are actually within much
closer reach than what is implied by the standard CO2reference emission scenarios. Having lower and more realistic
reference emissions projections not only gives a truer assessment of the policy efforts that are needed,but also
highlights the lower costs involved in mitigation efforts, thereby maximizing the likelihood of more widespread
energy and environmental policy efforts.
