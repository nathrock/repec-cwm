Title: Identifying Priorities in Infrastructure
Investment in Portugal

Abstract:  In this paper we use a vector autoregressive approach to analyze the effects of infrastructure
investment on economic performance using a newly developed data set for Portugal. Our overall
goal is to identify priorities in infrastructure investments, i.e., areas of infrastructures investments
with virtuous economic and budgetary effects. We find that investments in other transportation
infrastructures - railroads, ports and airports - and social infrastructures - health and education
infrastructures - have the largest effects with long-term multipliers of 15.00 and 8.45, respectively.
Investments in road transportation - roads and freeways - and on utilities - electricity, gas, water,
refineries, and telecommunications - induce much smaller effects with multipliers of 2.75 and 3.52,
respectively. We also show that for other transportation and social infrastructure investments, the
short-term effects are small relative to the accumulated effects and yet, in absolute terms, they
exceed the long-term effects for road transportation and utilities. Finally, we show that investments
in other infrastructures and in social infrastructures will pay for themselves in the form of long-term
enhanced tax revenues under rather reasonable effective tax rates. Overall, we have clearly identified
other transportation infrastructures and social infrastructures as the key target areas for policy
intervention in this context.
