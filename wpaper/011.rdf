Title:  Illustrating Adverse Selection in Health Insurance Markets with a Classroom Game
Abstract:  This paper describes a classroom game that illustrates the
effects of asymmetric information and adverse selection in health
insurance markets.  The first part of this game simulates a market in
which buyers can purchase insurance from sellers; in some periods,
government regulation of the insurance market prevents sellers from
using information about buyer type to determine premiums.  The results
demonstrate the classic prediction that asymmetric information will
result in adverse selection.  Here, low risk buyers will forego the
purchase of insurance at a measurable loss of potential earnings.  In
the second part of the game, sellers and buyers can trade two different
types of health insurance policies, one moderate and another generous. 
The results from this part show that adverse selection can lead to an
inefficient sorting of buyers across plans under government-mandated
community rating and limits on premium increases.  Under these
circumstances, no buyers will purchase the generous insurance plan.  The
paper provides a series of questions to stimulate class discussion on
the causes and consequences of adverse selection for consumers and
insurers, and solutions that can be implemented in employer and
government-sponsored programs.
