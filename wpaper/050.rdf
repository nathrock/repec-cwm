Title:  Direct Evidence on Risk Attitudes and Migration


Abstract:  Geographic mobility is important for the functioning of labor
markets because it brings labor resources to where they can be most
efficiently used. It has long been hypothesized that individuals'
migration propensities depend on their attitudes towards risk, but the
empirical evidence, to the extent that it exists, has been indirect. In
this paper, we use newly available data from the German Socio-Economic
Panel to measure directly the relationship between migration
propensities and attitudes towards risk. We find that individuals who
are more willing to take risks are more likely to migrate between labor
markets in Germany. This result is robust to stratifying by age, sex,
education, national origin, and a variety of other demographic
characteristics, as well as to the level of aggregation used to define
geographic mobility. The effect is substantial relative to the
unconditional migration propensity and compared to the conventional
determinants of migration. We also find that being more willing to take
risks is more important for the extensive than for the intensive margin
of migration.
