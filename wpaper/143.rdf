Title: How Predictable are Environmental Compliance Inspections?



Abstract: The goal of this paper is to examine the timing of environmental compliance inspections and
determine the extent to which such inspections can be predicted. The paper focuses on modeling
the inspections at hazardous waste facilities in the U.S. using detailed data on individual
inspections and facilities. The paper uses a number of parametric and semi-parametric duration
models to predict the timing of inspections and finds that the Exponential model provides the
best balance in terms of the explanatory power and simplicity of the model. However, even with
this model it is difficult to accurately predict the timing of most compliance inspections. The
paper also examines the extent to which using data on individual inspections can improve
empirical predictions about aggregate inspections. If the goal is to estimate the annual number of
inspections at hazardous waste facilities, neither the Exponential model or a Poisson model is
clearly superior. Which model is more appropriate depends on the question the researcher wants
to answer. Similarly, if the focus is on whether any inspection occurred in a given time period,
the benefits of using the Exponential model depend on the nature of the questions to be
answered. While the Exponential model performs better than a Probit model in predicting which
entities will be inspected, it also results in a higher number of "false positives," that is predicting
an inspection when no inspection actually occurs.
