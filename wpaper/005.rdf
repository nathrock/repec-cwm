Title:  State Social Capital and Individual Health Status
Abstract:  Recent  studies have  found that  two state-level  measures of social
capital, average levels  of civic participation  and trust, are  associated with
improvements  in  individual  health  status.  In  this  study  we  employ these
measures, together with the Putnam (2000) index, to examine several key  aspects
of the relationship between state social capital and individual health.  We find
that for all three measures,  the association with health status  persists after
carefully adjusting for  household income, and  that for two  measures, mistrust
and the Putnam index, the  size of this association warrants  further attention.
Using  the Putnam  index, we  find particular  support for  the hypothesis  that
social capital has a more pronounced salutary effect for the poor.  Our findings
generate both support for the social capital and health hypothesis and a  number
of implications for future research.
