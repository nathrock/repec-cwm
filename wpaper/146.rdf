Title: Rare Institutional Disruptions and Uphill Capital Flows



Abstract: The puzzle of "uphill capital flows," where capital flows out of countries with relatively
lower capital stocks and faster-growing TFP, has reattained prominence in the two
decades preceding the recent financial crisis in the form of a large and persistent United
States trade deficit with the rest of the world. Asymmetric investment risk has been
shown in other studies to be a significant driver of capital flows between countries; how
large does the risk have to be to drive capital uphill? This paper builds a model with two
large open economies to assess the strength of asymmetric risk as an "uphill" force
against the neoclassical "downhill" forces. I assess the model calibrating the foreign
country as China, since its "downhill" forces are quite strong. The model shows that if
risk arises from only the estimated Gaussian noise of TFP, relatively high coefficients of
risk aversion are needed to rationalize the large and steadily growing holdings by
foreigners of US assets over the decades preceding the crisis. However, TFP in middleincome
countries is subject to other shocks besides Gaussian noise. Recent studies have
documented the probability and magnitude of drops in output attributable to rare
disruptions to political institutions. This paper shows that this additional risk, even at
moderate levels of risk aversion, is enough to drive Foreign investors to engage in
decades-long flows of precautionary savings into the United States and quantitatively
dominate the effect of Foreign TFP catchup.
